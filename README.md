# Project-Planer
The project has done by Rayhan and jason.

le bouton filter n'est pas fonctionnel ainsi que le temps restant d'une t√¢che.

## Learning objectives

- Dynamic DOM manipulation
- Handling of dates
- UX/UI

### The mission

This is the list of features we would like to see:

- Allow user to create tasks. Tasks should have a name, a description and a due date
- Allow users to label their tasks with a status (ex: to do, doing, done)
- Display the tasks, with their remaining time. For instance, if today is the 15th of March and the task is due for the 20th of March, display in 5 days.
- Allow users to sort their tasks by remainining time, with the most urgent first, or by name.
- Filter tasks (ex: only show "to do" tasks)
- BONUS: Save tasks in LocalStorage, so that they persist even when the page is refreshed.
